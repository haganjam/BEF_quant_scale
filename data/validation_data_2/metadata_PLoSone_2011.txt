Metadata from: Gamfeldt, L., and H. Hillebrand. 2011. Effects of Total Resources, Resource Ratios, and Species Richness on Algal Productivity and Evenness at Both Metacommunity and Local Scales. Plos One 6.

Data are at the local-scale for the end of the experiment on biovolume for each of five algal species and N and P.

I havenâ€™t looked at these data (attached, for local scale only) since we published the paper. The meta-data are:

Id: id number for each local community
Tot_P: start concentration of P, mmol L-1 
Tot_N: start concentration of N, mmol L-1
N_P: N : P ratio. We had three ratios for each level of P
Species: Composition treatment. Ankistrodesmus sp. (Chlorophyta), Chlamydomonas terricola (Chlorophyta), Cylindrosper- mum sp. (Cyanobacteria), Fragilaria sapucina (Bacillariophyta), and Gymnodinium sp. (Dinophyta), All five species together. Substitutive design, starting biovolume of 231*103 mm3 mL-1. 
Biovol: Biovolume in each replicate. 
P: End concentration of P
